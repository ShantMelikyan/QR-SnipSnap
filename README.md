# QR-SnipSnap
# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: April 26, 2025_

## Introduction
QR SnipSnap ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes how we handle data when you use the Extension.

## Information We Collect

- **No Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**
  We do not collect names, email addresses, or any PII.

- **Local Chrome Storage**
  • **Generator text**: The last-entered text or URL in the QR generator is saved locally so you don’t lose it when closing the popup.
  • **Tab preference**: We remember whether you last used "Scan" or "Generate" to restore your view.

- **Screenshot Data (on Capture)**
  When you click "Capture QR," we grab a pixel snapshot of the selected region in the active browser tab. That image is processed immediately in your browser to decode the QR code and is not transmitted or stored by us beyond that moment.

## How We Use Your Data
All data processing happens locally in your browser. We only use your input to:

1. Decode a selected QR code.
2. Generate a new QR code from text or URLs.

No images, text, or other data ever leave your machine or go to external servers.

## Third-Party Libraries
We use the following open-source libraries, all of which run locally:
- **jsQR** for QR decoding
- **kjua** for QR generation
- **jsPDF** for PDF export

We do not send data to these libraries’ servers; they execute entirely in-browser.

## Data Security
- All data lives in your Chrome profile or in memory while the popup is open.
- We do not track, log, or transmit any usage or analytics data.

## Children’s Privacy
This Extension is not intended for users under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Privacy Policy Updates
We may update this policy. The "Last updated" date will reflect the most recent version.
